Proposed Guidelines:

License Heading
    All source files must begin with the licensing information shown at the top
    of this file.

Maximum line width
    All lines must be less than 80 characters in width. A long line in fortran
    source files should be continued with an ampersand. For example:

        k = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10)  &
            * (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10)

Tabs vs. spaces
    Use spaces for all alignments. Indentation uses 4 spaces instead of a tab.
    Set your text editor to emit 4 spaces when you press the tab key. Do loops
    should be indented 4 spaces.

    do i = 1, N
        {Do something}
    end do

    Sequential loops may be aligned together, as shown below.
    do i = 1, Nx
    do j = 1, Ny
        {Do something}
    end do
    end do

    However, use this style if the do loops do not appear together
    do i = 1, Nx
        {Do something}
        do j = 1, Ny
            {Do something else}
        end do
    end do

    Do not indent inside module, subroutine, and function blocks

Comments for modules and procedures.
    Demarcate modules and precures using a ***'s and place the description of the
    block directly below. The ***s should extend to the end of the column
    (80 character width). For example:

    !*******************************************************************************
    function foo() result(bar)
    !*******************************************************************************
    !
    ! This function returns bar when calling foo. bar = foo()
    !

Preprocessor directives
    We use C preprocessor directives to turn features on and off at compile time.
    In the fortran implementation, the directives must not be indented. As a
    result, indent other portions of the code as if these directives were not
    there. For example:

    if (dothis = .true.) then
        write(*,*) "dothis is true"
    #ifdef FLAG
    else
        write(*,*) "HELLO FLAG!"
    #endif
    endif

    If flag is defined, the preprocessor would write a file like this:

    if (dothis = .true.) then
        write(*,*) "dothis is true"
    else
        write(*,*) "HELLO FLAG!"
    endif

    if FLAG is not defined, the preprocessor would write a file like this:

    if (dothis = .true.) then
        write(*,*) "dothis is true"
    endif

Modules
    All modules that need to have memory allocated or preliminary values
    calculated must have a subroutine called MODULENAME_init that is called in
    initialize().

    Deallocation of memory must be performed in a subrotuine MODULENAME_finalize
    that is called in finalize().
